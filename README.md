# Machine Learning Basics

This repository contains code written during the Summer of 2019 documenting my foray 
into machine learning. Most of this repository uses the sk-learn library. Some of the last 
programs use Theano and Keras. 

I used the book [Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/books/)
for the methods and [Gilbert Strang's MIT 18.06](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
 course for Linear Algebra.
